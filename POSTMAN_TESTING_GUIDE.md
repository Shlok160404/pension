## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: "User not authenticated"**
**Solution:** Make sure you're including the `Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}` header

### **Issue: "No pension data found"**
**Solution:** The test user might not have pension data. Check if you need to create sample data first.

### **Issue: "Server connection refused"**
**Solution:** Make sure your FastAPI server is running on port 8000

### **Issue: "JWT token expired"**
**Solution:** Re-run the login request to get a fresh token

## üéâ **Success Criteria**

‚úÖ **All tests pass without errors**  
‚úÖ **JWT authentication works**  
‚úÖ **AI queries return meaningful responses**  
‚úÖ **PDF search gracefully handles missing documents**  
‚úÖ **User data endpoints return correct information**

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Testing**

1. **Frontend Integration**: Use the working endpoints in your React frontend
2. **PDF Upload**: Test with real pension documents
3. **Role-Based Testing**: Test advisor and regulator endpoints
4. **Performance Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent users

## üìû **Need Help?**

If any tests fail:
1. Check the server logs for error messages
2. Verify your database connection
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Check that the server is running on the correct port

**Happy Testing! üß™‚ú®**
